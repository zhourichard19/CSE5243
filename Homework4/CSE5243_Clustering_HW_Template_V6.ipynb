    "# Section: Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will perform clustering on three datasets.  Your will choose suitable clustering algorithms, evaluate them on the datasets, and compare their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "1.\tUnderstand how to select and evaluate suitable off-the-shelf clustering algorithms based on the characteristics of a dataset and the outcomes you need.\n",
    "2.\tUnderstand how to tune and evaluate a clustering algorithm to achieve good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file **small_Xydf.csv** is a two-dimensional dataset with 200 records.  It contains columns X0, X1, and y.  The y column is the actual cluster number that was produced by the dataset generation algorithm.  Do not use it for the clustering algorithm.  It will be used to evaluate your clustering algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file **large1_Xydf.csv** is a two-dimensional dataset with 3000 records.  It contains columns X0, X1, and y.  The y column is the actual cluster number that was produced by the dataset generation algorithm.  Do not use it for the clustering algorithm.  It will be used to evaluate your clustering algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file **large2_Xydf.csv** is a two-dimensional dataset with 3000 records.  It contains columns X0, X1, and y.  The y column is the actual cluster number that was produced by the dataset generation algorithm.  Do not use it for the clustering algorithm.  It will be used to evaluate your clustering algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework makes use of the Clustering Algorithms offered by the SciKitLearn Library.  Study the information at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html.  Follow the guidance in the individual sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you should work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, to get advice on general Python usage, etc., but your work should be your own.  Please make use of Microsoft Teams!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need to Turn In:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCode\n",
    "-\tFor this homework, the code is the Jupyter Notebook.  Use the provided Jupyter Notebook template, and fill in the appropriate information.\n",
    "-\tThis homework requires you to use clustering algorithms in the SciKitLearn library.  You also may use common Python libraries for I/O, data manipulation, data visualization, etc. (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib,…).  You may not use library operations that perform, in effect, the entire “core” computations for this homework. (e.g., If you happen to find a single function on the web that does essentially *all* of a major portion of the homework, you may not use it.)  When in doubt, ask the grader or instructor.\n",
    "-\tThe code must be written by you, and any significant code snips you found on the Internet and used to understand how to do your coding for the core functionality must be attributed.  (You do not need to attribute basic functionality – matrix operations, IO, etc.)\n",
    "-\tThe code must be commented sufficiently to allow a reader to understand the algorithm without reading the actual Python, step by step.\n",
    "-\tWhen in doubt, ask the grader or instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWritten Report\n",
    "-\tFor this homework, the report is the Jupyter Notebook.  The report should be well-written.  Please proof-read and remove spelling and grammar errors and typos.\n",
    "-\tThe report should discuss your analysis and observations. Key points and findings must be written in a style suitable for consumption by non-experts.  Present charts and graphs to support your observations. If you performed any data processing, cleaning, etc., please discuss it within the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Turn In Your Work on Carmen:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please follow these instructions exactly** - it helps the grading process.  If you have questions, please ask.  Submit your Jupyter Noebook to Carmen - do not ZIP or PDF it. You do not need to include the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading:\n",
    "\n",
    "0.\tOverall readability and organization of your report (10%) - Is it well organized and does the presentation flow in a logical manner; are there many grammar and spelling mistakes; do the charts/graphs relate to the text, etc.\n",
    "1.\tEvaluation of the KNN Clustering Algorithm on the Small Dataset (15%) – Is your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "2.\tEvaluation of the KNN Clustering Algorithm on the Large1 Dataset (15%) – Is your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "3.\tEvaluation of the KNN Clustering Algorithm on the Large2 Dataset (15%) – Is your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "4.\tEvaluation of the Second Clustering Algorithm on the Large2 Dataset (15%) – Is your choice of algorithm and your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "5.\tEvaluation of the Third Clustering Algorithm on the Large2 Dataset (15%) – Is your choice of algorithm and your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "6.\tComparison of the Three Clustering Algorithms (10%) - Is the comparison sound?  Did you choose a specific clustering algorithm as best and explain why?\n",
    "7.\tConclusions (5%) – Did you document your overall insights? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions and Helpful Hints:\n",
    "- Consider putting all of your \"discussion\" text in markdown cells, not inline with code. That gives you more control over formatting. Markdown cheat sheet: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet\n",
    "- Consider creating re-usable functions for some common operations - you will be doing the same sorts of things multiple times below.\n",
    "- Explain what you are doing, and why.  Explain what you found out or learned.\n",
    "- *Make sure you run your entire workbook before handing it in, so the output cells are populated.*\n",
    "- Follow the Section structure as much as possible - put your content where it is requested, so we can find your answers.\n",
    "- If you have questions on expectations or need clarification or guidance, please ask.  Post to Teams if it is a general question, so everyone benefits.\n",
