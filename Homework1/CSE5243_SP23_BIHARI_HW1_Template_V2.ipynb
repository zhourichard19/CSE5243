    "### Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will analyze an ALTERED copy of the “Hotel Booking Demand” dataset.\n",
    "- This dataset was pulled on 4/8/22 from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand\n",
    "- The dataset file is named: **hotel_bookings_with_errors_V1.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data has been altered slightly for use in course assignments,etc.:**\n",
    "- A unique ROW attribute has been added.\n",
    "- Errors have been added, such as: duplicated records, deleted records, deleted attribute values, erroneous attribute values.\n",
    "**DO NOT PUBLISH THIS DATASET - it contains intentionally wrong data!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment covers the **first three of the six steps** of the **CRISP-DM process model** (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation). (See the CRISP-DM materials on CARMEN.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objectives** of this assignment are:\n",
    "- By analyzing and thinking critically about the data, you may identify interesting charcteristics that would be useful when using the data.\n",
    "- The final, cleaned-up dataset that you create may be used to build classification / regression models in assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Assume that you are the Director of Data Science for Buckeye Resorts, Inc. (BRI), an international hotel chain.  As is the case for all hotel chains, reservation cancellations cause significant impacts to BRI, in profitability, logistics, and other areas.  The cost to BRI of a cancelled reservation is $500 on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "- BRI wants to improve (decrease) the cancellation rates at its hotels, using more tailored interventions, based on newly available detailed data.  BRI processes 100,000 reservations per year, so an incremental improvement in cancellation rates would have a significant impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One intervention being considered is to offer a special financial incentive to customers who have reservations, but who are “at risk” of cancellation.  BRI has performed a small pilot test, and has found that offering a $100 discount to a customer who is planning to cancel is effective 30% of the time in inducing the customer not to cancel (by locking in a “no cancellation” clause).\n",
    "\n",
    "- BRI leadership has asked your team to analyze the new data, and determine if it is suitable for developing analyses and models that would be effective in predicting which future reservations are likely to be at risk of cancellation, so the aforementioned financial incentive could be offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The head of BRI would then like you attend the upcoming BRI Board of Directors meeting.  She has asked you to present your findings to her and to the BOD, to help them decide whether to go forward with the planned tailored intervention approach, and/or to adjust or abandon the approach.  Your goal is to support the BOD in making a decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to look at the dataset, **explore (understand)** what it contains, and **create (prepare)** a clean dataset from it that contains the kind of information you think might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not yet know the specific algorithm, formula or model you will use to predict cancallations.  **That will come in a later step.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things To Do\n",
    "Complete the sections for the first three steps of CRISP-DM in this notebook.  Some intial guidance / sugggestions:\n",
    "- **Business Understanding**: Fill in the cells, using your thoughts on the specific item.  Your answers will not be graded for \"correctness\", just \"thoughtfulness\".  Feel free to \"invent\" a narrative for detailed information not provided above.  Don't spend a lot of time on it.\n",
    "- **Data Understanding**: There are many attributes in this dataset. Once you have done some initial analysis, you may choose to concentrate on ones that seem more promising or useful.  However, you must give evidence and explain why the attributes that you choose to give less attention warrant the lack of attention. \n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: Clean up the data and save it for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential that you **communicate** your goals, thought process, actions, results, and conclusions to the **audience** that will consume this work.  It is **not enough** to show just the code.  It is not appropriate to show long sections of **unexplained printout**, etc.  Be kind to your readers and provide value to them!\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALWAYS follow this pattern** when doing **each portion** of the work.  This allows us to give feedback and assign scores, and to give partial credit.  Make it easy for the reader to understand your work.\n",
    "- Say (briefly) **what** you are trying to do, and **why**.\n",
    "- Do it (code).\n",
    "- Show or describe the **result** clearly (and briefly as needed), and explain the significant **conclusions or insights** derived from the results. \n",
