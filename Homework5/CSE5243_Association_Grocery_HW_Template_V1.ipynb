    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the \"AssociationsGroceriesDataV1.xlsx\" dataset provided on Carmen to find potential association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "- Practice the Association Analysis content we covered this semester.\n",
    "- Understand “why” the particular topics, techniques, etc., are important from a practical perspective.\n",
    "- Understand how to choose and use appropriate tools to solve the provided problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "- This workbook contains is a market basket dataset containing transactions.\n",
    "- The data file captures the data in \"long format\". Specifically, every row corresponds to the transaction id and the item. If the specific transaction id has multiple items, there will be multiple rows in the data.\n",
    "- You can process the data however you like, but it is recommended you convert into a one-hot-encoded data structure. This will allow you to easily use the mlxtend package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Business Problem\n",
    "- Assume this dataset contains all of the transactions for one month for our store.  We wish to find association rules that would improve our revenue as follows:\n",
    "  - We would discount one of our products by 10% each month, with the hope that this would encourage customers to visit our store to purchse that product 5% more frequently, and also purchase  other products (that are not discounted) more frequently.\n",
    "- Practically speaking, we would like to come up with **two-item** rules (one antecedent and one consequent: (A -> B)) and choose the one that best adds to our revenues  (based on the rule support, confidence, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proper Answers\n",
    "- To make everyone's lives a little easier, when writing Itemsets and Rules, please list the items in **lexagraphical order**: {A}, {B}, {A,B}, {A,C}, {A,B,C},…, {A,B,C}->{D}, {A,B}->{C,D}\n",
    "    - If you have trouble doing so, please post to Teams and we will offer suggestions.\n",
    "- **IMPORTANT:** When answering the numbered questions below, make sure to **label your answer with the question number**.  This will help us give appropriate grades.\n",
    "  - EXAMPLE: \"**Question 2A:** The Total Number of Itemsets is 19\"\n",
    "- **IMPORTANT:** **Show your work** and **explain it**.  This will help us give partial credit in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "For this assignment, you should work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, but your work should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need to Turn In\n",
    "- Submit this Jupyter Notebook in .IPYNB format.  Do not \"zip\" the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Feel free to use the **mlxtend** package throughout this assignment.\n",
    "- If a question asks you to \"calculate\" the number of \"all possible rules\", etc., explain the calculation by showing the \"formula\" you used. This will act as \"showing your work\".\n",
